    title: Speaking about Working Together
  - coach: Peter Bregman
    description: >-
      This cutting-edge leadership training is based on one of the core
      learnings of Peter’s 30 years of experience working with CEOs and senior
      leaders at some of the world’s premier organizations: if you are willing
      to feel everything, you can do anything. At this highest levels, leaders
      don’t fail to act powerfully because of a gap in knowledge or ability.
      They fail to respond forcefully because they are unwilling to feel the
      challenging emotions leadership requires. This training is designed to
      develop four qualities that the most effective leaders demonstrate:
      confidence in self, connection to others, commitment to purpose, and most
      importantly, Emotional Courage. It is not about simulations. It’s about
      real progress on real issues that will help leaders grow as individuals to
      move their organizations forward.

  - coach: Sandy Ogg
    description: "If you’re a CEO, chances are somewhat slim that you know exactly which roles in your organization are absolutely critical to realizing your company’s value agenda, who you have in them, and how well they are doing.\_Often CEOs believe their job is to set direction and strategy, to orchestrate execution and manage performance. Talent is largely the domain of human resources and the CHRO; value is predominantly the domain of finance and the CFO. Or are they? Rarely do we three C-suite leaders—the CEO, CFO and CHRO—come together to flag the specific roles in our company  that drive value. And even if we do, it is even more rare that we monitor the incumbents in those specific roles for their contributions to value, their level of engagement, and their capacity. Yet their contributions are what we are relying on to secure our performance today and make future growth possible."

      We help managers and leaders develop — and keep — the coaching habit. When
      managers become more coach-like, coaching ceases to be a one-off formal
      event and instead becomes a part of their everyday repertoire.


      This innovative, award-winning program is an introduction to coaching
      skills for managers and leaders. Beginning with a half-day session, The
      Coaching Habit program shows busy managers how to slay the advice monster
      so that they can say less, ask more and change the way they lead forever.
      To ensure that it becomes an innate way of leading and interacting, we
      deliver tools and accountability systems to get it “in their bones.”
