    Leadership expert Sally Helgesen and bestselling leadership coach Marshall
    Goldsmith have trained thousands of high achievers—men and women—to reach
    even greater heights. Again and again, they see that women face specific and
    different roadblocks from men as they advance in the workplace. In fact, the
    very habits that helped women early in their careers can hinder them as they
    move up. Simply put, what got you here won't get you there... and you might
    not even realize your blind spots until it's too late.
