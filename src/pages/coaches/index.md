She believes that both leadership development and coaching involve leading with questions as much as, if not more than directing with answers. Additionally, she believes that leadership development and coaching need to be able to help clients face realities, discard old identities, renegotiate both inner and outer loyalties that may or may not be serving her and much more.\r\n\n\rAnu’s current work involves working extensively with women and men in the fields of diversity and inclusion. She has trained or coached over three thousand people in this field. Her work with women focusses on helping them become aware of and grounded in their value, thereby breaking their “inner glass ceiling”. She also works with them on increasing their impact and influence through better negotiation and navigation of organizational power and politics\r\n\n\rAnu is one of the few people in India who have written about what corporates can do to facilitate broader social inclusion through CSR initiatives and other HR practices that can address some of the most deeply rooted, rigid social hierarchies.\r\n\n\rShe enjoys teaching and especially treasures her experiences of leading sessions at the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, Harvard University and Columbia University."

This question-centric project, conducted in collaboration with Clayton Christensen, is surfacing insights into how leaders build better questions to unlock game-changing solutions. Gregersen is also founder of The 4-24 Project, an initiative dedicated to rekindling the provocative power of asking the right questions in adults so they can pass this crucial creativity skill onto the next generation.\r\n\n\rGregersen has co-authored ten books and published over 50 articles, book chapters, and cases on leading innovation and change. His research has been highlighted in global media such\r\n\nas BBC, CNN, The Economist, Fast Company, Financial Times, Forbes, Fortune, Inc., The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.

      Price Pritchett grew up on a dusty, windblown farm in the flatlands of
      Texas some 80 miles south of Amarillo. He says, “Mother Nature ran the
      place. We merely farmed it.” Having mastered the art of plowing with John
      Deere tractors by the age of nine, he went on to earn B.A. and M.A.
      degrees in English from West Texas A&M University, then a Ph.D. in
      psychology from Texas Tech University.

      Today Dr. Pritchett is one of the foremost experts on personal and
      organizational change. His firm-PRITCHETT, LP-is recognized worldwide for
      its thought leadership in merger integration strategy, corporate culture,
      and change management.

      His book, After the Merger: Managing the Shockwaves-named “One of the 10
      Best Business Books of the Year” by Library Journal, was the first ever
      written on M&A integration and (in its Third Edition) stands as the
      classic text on the topic. He also is author of the all-time bestseller on
      mergers, The Employee Guide to Mergers an d Acquisitions. Since founding
      PRITCHET T in 1974, he has authored half a dozen million-sellers on
      mergers, culture, plus personal and organizational change. With over 20
      million of his 30+ books and handbooks in print, many translated into
      foreign languages, he stands as one of the best-selling business authors
      in the world.

      Dr. Pritchett’s firm has consulted on some of the world’s largest mergers
      and corporate change projects, with his work taking him throughout Europe,
      Asia, and the Americas. His client list stands as a “Who’s Who” of
      business. Most of the Fortune 1000 companies have used some combination of
      PRITCHETT ‘s consulting, training, and publications. His work has been
      referenced in many of the major business journals and newspapers plus
      featured on CNN, CNBC, and other major television channels.

      His current focus is on advising boards of directors and executive teams,
      as well as speaking and writing. Keynote audiences include executive
      groups at many prestigious organizations such as Honeywell, American

      Dr. Pritchett’s newest innovation is clips. These captivating 60-second
      coaching videos are designed to:

      * Fit people’s shrinking attention span

      * Penetrate the noise in today’s information-overloaded world

  - bio: "Dr. Shah brings over twenty years of experience in business, government, and philanthropy to The Rockefeller Foundation.  Appointed as USAID Administrator by President Obama in 2009, Dr. Shah was charged with reshaping the $20 billion agency’s operations to provide greater assistance to pressing development challenges around the globe. By elevating the importance of innovation, promoting public-private partnerships, rethinking internal practices, and shifting how dollars were spent to deliver stronger results, Shah secured bipartisan support that enabled USAID to dramatically accelerate its work to end extreme poverty. Two significant Presidential priorities – Feed the Future and Power Africa – passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and were signed into law by President Obama, and the Global Food Security Act is the second largest global development legislation after PEPFAR.  Shah’s work delivered results for countries facing democratic transitions, post-conflict situations, and humanitarian crises, and is widely credited with providing life-saving access to food, health, and water for millions of children across the planet. \r\n\n\rDr. Shah is a graduate of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and the Wharton School of Business.  Prior to his appointment at USAID, Shah served as Chief Scientist and Undersecretary for Research, Education and Economics at the United States Department of Agriculture.  He also served in a number of leadership roes at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where he helped launch the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (a joint venture by the Gates and Rockefeller foundations) and the International Financing Facility for Immunization (credited with raising more than $5 billion for childhood immunizations worldwide) and where he supported the creation of the Global Development Program."
