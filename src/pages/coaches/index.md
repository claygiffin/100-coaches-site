      critical national and international issues and advance positive social and
      economic initiatives throughout the world.

      Mrs. Hesselbein with the Maud Ballington Booth Legacy Award for a lifetime
      of pioneering social change.


      For her exceptional work and her continued commitment to developing

      from ATHENA International, Best Practice Institute, the Girl Scout Council
