      Right now, the "add" button uses whichever label is being applied to the
      label property of a list. However, the add button only adds a singular
      item to a list, so it does not make sense to ever use the plural label
      there if a singular label is available.

      Michael Bungay Stanier is the Senior Partner of Box of Crayons, a company
      that helps organizations do less Good Work and more Great Work. Box of
      Crayons is best known for its coaching programs, which give busy managers
      practical tools so they can coach in 10 minutes or less.


      On the way to founding Box of Crayons in 2002, Michael lived in Australia,
      England, the United States and Canada, his current home.


      He’s written two books that have each sold close to 100,000 copies, the
      Wall Street Journal bestsellers _The Coaching Habit_ and _Do More Great
      Work_. He’s proudest of End Malaria, a collection of essays about Great
      Work by thought leaders that raised $400,000 for Malaria No More.


      To balance all this out, Michael was banned from his high school
      graduation for “the balloon incident,” was sued by one of his law school
      lecturers for defamation and managed to give himself a concussion while
      digging a hole as a labourer.
