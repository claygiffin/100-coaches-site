      This cutting-edge leadership training is based on one of the core
      learnings of Peter’s 30 years of experience working with CEOs and senior
      leaders at some of the world’s premier organizations: if you are willing
      to feel everything, you can do anything. At this highest levels, leaders
      don’t fail to act powerfully because of a gap in knowledge or ability.
      They fail to respond forcefully because they are unwilling to feel the
      challenging emotions leadership requires. This training is designed to
      develop four qualities that the most effective leaders demonstrate:
      confidence in self, connection to others, commitment to purpose, and most
      importantly, Emotional Courage. It is not about simulations. It’s about
      real progress on real issues that will help leaders grow as individuals to
      move their organizations forward.
